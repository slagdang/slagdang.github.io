This is a public website for my projects I wish to feature.

## This first one is a teardown I did of a smart switch I bought that uses matter and thread.

[Here is a KiCAD 9.x project with a reverse engineered schematic and PCB layout for this hardware.](https://github.com/slagdang/rev-m-smart-switch)

Pictures of the board in question are here. The switch is sold by Meross. It allows switching of the outlet and measurement of the power used by the connected device.
