This is a public website for my projects I wish to feature.

## This first one is a teardown I did of a smart switched outlet I bought that uses matter for control

[Here is a KiCAD 9.x project with a reverse engineered schematic and PCB layout for this hardware.](https://github.com/slagdang/rev-m-smart-switch)

Pictures of the board in question are here. The switched outlet is sold by Meross. They describe it as a Matter smart plug, but it is a switched outlet on a small box which plugs into your wall outlet. It uses WiFi over IPv6 over WiFi. It does not use Thread. This is for US voltage and outlets. It was purchased in July 2025. The device allows switching of the outlet and measurement of the power and energy used by the connected device.
