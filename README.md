## Smart switched outlets (2025)

The first two are teardowns of two (competing) smart switched outlets that I bought
in 2025. One is from Tapo, one is from Meross. Both are affordable units.

How does a compact affordable device control 1800W of AC power?

## EcoBee smart thermostat power extender kit

The second is a teardown of a device used by EcoBee to solve issues in retrofitting
smart thermostats into older installations which do not provide power for the
smart thermostat to operate.

Normally residential HVAC control requires one wire per function to be controlled
plus one additional wire. So an install with heating, cooling and fan control will
have four wires. Adding power for the thermostat requires an additional wire, for a
total of five wires. When your home only has four wires in the wall this adapter
is used to send the three control signals plus two wires for power over the existing
four wires. How does it do it?
